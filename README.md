# ICAS Lucknow-III — Website & Backend (Phase 1)

Full-stack Node.js/Express + MongoDB app for **ICAS Lucknow-III**, a chapter
of the Indian Council of Astrological Sciences based at Purushottamanand
Ashram, Iradat Nagar, Hasanganj, Lucknow. Covers **Section 15, Phase 1** of
the project spec: a public marketing website plus the admissions/enquiries/
payments backend behind it.

**Chapter scope, verified against the official ICAS registry**
(icasindia.org/ICAS/Centres.html): this chapter is registered to teach
**Jyotish Praveena and Jyotish Visharada only**, both online and in direct
classroom, coordinated by Shri Markandeya Shukla. Earlier drafts of this site
incorrectly included Vastu/Nakshatra/Bhushan courses pulled from a different
chapter's site (Lucknow-II) — corrected. Don't add other course types back
without confirming this chapter has been registered to teach them.

Live classes (Section 5.5, using **Microsoft Teams** per your requirement) and
the full curriculum/video/PDF LMS (Section 5.2–5.8) are **Phase 2** — not in
this delivery.

## What's included

**Public website** (`/public`) — Home, Courses (live-filtered catalogue),
Course detail, Who We Are, Contact/Enquiry, Register, Log In, Student
Dashboard, Policies. Design is a custom system grounded in the chapter's own
emblem (vermillion/marigold/indigo palette) and Vedic astrology's own
geometry (the kundli chart's diamond-in-square as a recurring structural
motif) — not a generic template. Served as static files by the same Express
app, same-origin, so there's no CORS or separate deployment to manage.

**Backend API** — auth, course catalogue, student registration + document
upload, Razorpay payments, admin approval workflow, admin dashboard metrics.

## Stack

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT auth (roles: `admin`, `instructor`, `student`)
- Multer (local disk in Phase 1 — swap for S3/Blob before production scale)
- Razorpay (order creation, client-side signature verification, webhook) —
  lazily initialized, so missing keys degrade gracefully instead of crashing
  the app on boot
- Nodemailer (SMTP transactional email)
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend (no build step, no framework) — fetches from
  the same-origin `/api` at runtime

## Setup

```bash
cd astrologic-lms
cp .env.example .env      # fill in real values (MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.)
npm install
npm run seed               # creates the first admin user from .env
npm run seed:courses        # seeds Jyotish Praveena + Visharada (the only courses this chapter is officially registered to teach)
npm run dev                  # starts on http://localhost:5000 - visit / for the website
```

Requires a MongoDB connection string — for hosted deployment (e.g.
Hostinger's MongoDB Atlas connector), see the notes below. Locally or on any
other host, set `MONGODB_URI` (or `MONGO_URI`) directly in `.env`.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Student self-registration |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Login (any role) |
| GET | `/api/courses` | Catalogue with filters (category, level, mode, language, instructor, certification, search) |
| GET | `/api/courses/:slug` | Course detail + upcoming batches |
| POST | `/api/enquiries` | Public enquiry form |

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Own profile |
| PUT | `/api/students/me` | Update profile fields |
| POST | `/api/students/me/documents` | Upload a document (multipart, field `document`, body `type`) |
| POST | `/api/students/me/register-interest` | Register interest in a course/batch |
| GET | `/api/students/me/dashboard` | Dashboard summary (Section 8) |
| POST | `/api/payments/create-order` | Create Razorpay order for fee/instalment |
| POST | `/api/payments/verify` | Verify payment signature client-side |

### Admin (JWT required, role=admin)

## Admission workflow (matches Section 6.2)

```
register (auth) → register-interest (course) → upload documents
  → under_verification → payment → admin review (approve/reject)
  → allocate-batch → batch_allocated → LMS access (Phase 2)
```

## Notes before production

- **File storage**: `middleware/upload.js` uses local disk. Move to S3/Azure
  Blob before deploying anywhere with an ephemeral filesystem.
- **Razorpay webhook**: needs the *raw* request body for signature
  verification — already wired correctly in `server.js` (mounted before
  `express.json()`). Don't reorder that.
- **Email**: swap in real SMTP credentials; failures are logged, not thrown,
  so a broken mailer won't block registrations/payments.
- **Rate limiting**: basic limiter on `/api/auth` and `/api/enquiries` only —
  tune for production traffic.
